# 👋 Introduction & Bio 
💻 Hi, I’m Marieta Milenkova. Driven by a passion for quality and a commitment to excellence, I am a self-motivated Junior QA Engineer with a sound work ethic and a strong attention to detail. 

🧠 Yes, I am marketing expert and novice QA but I am open to the opportunities where I can get into it, becouse frequently learned new technology, and experienced working with many software tools and mobile apps at work. I'm organized with tasks, detail-oriented and have an experienced working with many different roles. 

🌱 In addition to my technical expertise, I am a creative problem-solver and a skilled communicator, with a talent for collaborating effectively with cross-functional teams. I am always eager to learn and to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in software testing and quality assurance.

👀 When I'm not testing software, you can find me exploring new hiking trails, lifting weights at the gym, or experimenting in the kitchen with new recipes. I believe in the power of a healthy work-life balance and strive to bring that perspective to everything I do.
